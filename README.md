# dragon-continuous-sim
A Python simulation modeling dragon growth, energy, and population dynamics inspired by Game of Thrones. Tracks age-based changes in size, metabolism, flight, and fire-breathing, while estimating environmental impacts, prey requirements, and realistic population limits across life stages.
